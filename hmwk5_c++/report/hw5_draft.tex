\section*{Concepts}

The key differences among general directed graph (DG), directed acyclic graph (DAG) and directed tree (DT) are:

$\bullet$ DG consists of vertices and edges. DG can add, remove, assign values to and get values of vertices and edges.

$\bullet$ DAG is a DG. Additionally, DAG must have no cycles, thus has a topological ordering of vertices.

$\bullet$ DT is a DAG. Additionally, DT must have a root vertex/node that has no parent node, all other nodes must have exactly one parent. DT must be connected, i.e. there exists a path from root node to every node in DT.

Three concepts are established to describe the differences above.

\section*{Architecture}

$\bullet$ \textbf{basic.h}\\
Contains definitions of basic data structures and concepts, including:\\
\-\hspace{.5cm} $\bullet$  \textit{struct vertex} for vertex,\\
\-\hspace{.5cm} $\bullet$  \textit{struct directed\_edge} for edge,\\
\-\hspace{.5cm} $\bullet$  \textit{struct base\_graph} for basic directed graph, represented as adjacent list, containing basic operation member functions,\\
\-\hspace{.5cm} $\bullet$  \textit{concept bool DG, DAG, DT} for concepts.

$\bullet$ \textbf{dg.h}\\
For \textit{struct directed\_graph}, which has a member of \textit{struct base\_graph} and multiple member functions such as set\_value(), insert\_vertices() and to\_string(). The constructor takes various inputs.


$\bullet$ \textbf{dag.h}\\
For \textit{struct directed\_acyclic\_graph}, which also contains a member of \textit{struct base\_graph} and multiple member functions that all have same names as those of \textit{struct directed\_graph}. To meet the concept requirements, it has additional functions such as topological\_order() that \textit{struct directed\_graph} does not have. The constructor functions differ from those of \textit{struct directed\_graph} in that they check for cycles caused by input.

$\bullet$ \textbf{dt.h}\\
For \textit{struct directed\_tree}, which is similar with \textit{struct directed\_acyclic\_graph} but with member functions for root and more validation in constructors.

$\bullet$ \textbf{graphop.h}\\
Overloading operation functions on graphs based on concepts defined for DG, DAG and DT. For example, add\_edge(\textbf{DG}\&, Edge\_ptr) adds edge to a graph, while add\_edge(\textbf{DAG}\&, Edge\_ptr) only adds edge if it does not cause cycle, and add\_edge(\textbf{DT}\&, Edge\_ptr) requires the edge to not only not cause cycle, but also not violate the one-parent rule of trees.

$\bullet$ \textbf{dfs.h}\\
For \textit{class DFS} that runs Depth-first-search.

For testing purposes,

$\bullet$ \textbf{gmaker.h}\\
Generates various vectors of vertices and edges to construct graphs.

$\bullet$ \textbf{main.cpp}\\
Contains main testing functions.

\section*{Leaks}

The \textit{Vertex\_ptr} and \textit{Edge\_ptr} are \textit{shared\_ptr} and put into STL containers so that they can be freed when there is no reference. There is no memory leakage detected in tests.
